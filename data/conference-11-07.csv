11/07/18|04:15:49 PM|ksedivyhaley|0|0|Risk debate, #CSPC2018: Should we ignore cheap ways to reduce risk just because risk is already below a threshold? Tolerability can change quickly as fix becomes cheaper. Have to have a larger-picture look at risk rather than just comparing numbers to thresholds.
